This tool is designed to visualize up-to-date research body related to hyperscanning with digital components by:

- **Displaying included studies** and their characteristics.
- **Visualizing trends** and (subjective) categorization.
- Integrating **user-submitted studies**.
- Providing **transparent inclusion/exclusion** overviews related to the original paper.

st.subheader("Purpose")
st.markdown("""
This living literature review tracks emerging research on multimodal hyperscanning in contexts with a digital 
component. The platform includes various categories, such as interaction scenario, type of tasks, measurement 
modalities, and analysis approaches, serving as a dynamic open-access resource. 
The aim is to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of digital hyperscanning research, 
enabling researchers to stay informed about the latest developments in the field.
Eventually, the platform will also include hyperscanning studies that do not involve a digital component, as well as 
extending the scope to include other population groups, such as children or clinical populations.
