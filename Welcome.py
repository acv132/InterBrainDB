### Purpose
This living literature review tracks emerging research on multimodal hyperscanning in collaborative contexts. The 
platform includes various categories, such as interaction scenario, measurement modalities, and analysis approaches, 
serving as a dynamic open-access resource. 
The aim is to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of research, enabling researchers to stay informed about the latest developments in the field.
