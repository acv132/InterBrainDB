measurement modality: Describes the type of physiological or behavioral data collected
  during the study (e.g., EEG, eye-tracking).
pairing configuration: Specifies the grouping size and structure of participants (e.g.,
  dyads, triads).
pairing setup: Defines the gender-based setup of participant pairs or groups (e.g.,
  female-female, male-male).
relationship pair: Describes the prior relationship between participants (e.g., parent-child,
  unfamiliar individuals).
interaction scenario: The physical or virtual arrangement in which participants interact
  (e.g., face-to-face, virtual). Based on Balters et al. (2021) https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-76324-4_2
interaction manipulative: Specifies how participants interact with physical or digital
  elements and the modality of communication involved. Based on Balters et al. (2021) https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-76324-4_2
type of communication: Defines the communication goal or openness in the interaction
  (e.g., goal-driven vs. open-ended). Based on Balters et al. (2020) https://doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2020.588494

cognitive function: Indicates the cognitive processes targeted or measured by the
  study (e.g., attention, memory).
paradigm: Refers to the experimental task or framework used to study social interaction
  (e.g., imitation, cooperation). Based on Wang et al. (2018) https://doi.org/10.21037/qims.2018.09.07
task symmetry: Pertains to whether participants had the same or different roles/tasks
  during the paradigm. Based on Wikstr√∂m (2022) https://helda.helsinki
