We aimed at investigating the effect of face-to-face vs. computer-mediated interaction, of role (candidate, recruiter), and of the interview phase (introductory, attitudinal, techni-cal, conclusive) on intra-brain and inter-brain connectivity measures and autonomic synchronization. Twenty expert recruiters and potential candidates took part in a hyperscanning investigation. Namely, electroencephalography (delta, theta, alpha, beta bands) and autonomic (skin-conductance, heart-rate) data were collected in candidate-recruiter dyads during a simulated job interview and then concurrently analyzed. Analyses highlighted a link between face-to-face condition and greater intra-/inter-brain connectivity indices in delta and theta bands. Furthermore, intra-brain and inter-brain connectivity measures were higher for delta and theta bands in the final interview phases compared to the first ones. Consistently, autonomic synchronization was higher during the final interview phases, specifically in the face-to-face condition. Finally, recruiters showed higher intra-brain connectivity in the delta range over frontal and temporoparietal areas, while candidates showed higher intra-brain connectivity in the theta range over frontal areas. Findings highlight the value of hyperscanning investigations in exploring social attunement in professional contexts and hint at their potential to foster neuroscience-informed practices in human resource management processes. \copyright 2022 by the authors.

In this study, we hypothesized that subjective ratings of answers should be useful for evaluating the answer quality in creative problem solving. To test this hypothesis and extract objective indicators of the subjective ratings of answers, we evaluated the relationship between subjective ratings of task performance and behavioral and autonomic nervous activities during a creative problem-solving task performed via online conversation. The task involved an answerer and a supporter, and in the experiment, each pair performed 10 trials. The trials were categorized as highly or lowly rated according to the answerer’s confidence in the answer. The task performance and behavioral and autonomic nervous activities were then compared between these categories of trials. Behavioral activity was evaluated via movements and speech activities, while for autonomic nervous activity, sympathetic nervous activity (SNA) was evaluated via skin conductance. The task performance was significantly better in the highly rated trials, whereas there were no significant differences in the behavioral activities between the highly and lowly rated trials. Moreover, in the highly rated trials, the skin conductance of the answerer was significantly high, whereas that of the supporter was significantly low. The results support the hypothesis and suggest that contrasting differences in SNA between an answerer and a supporter are indicators of the subjective ratings of answers in creative problem solving. © Copyright © 2021 Numata, Kotani and Sato.;numata2021relationshipbe;True;;['ECG', 'EDA', 'other'];within-subjects;9;healthy adults;dyad;mm;familiar;virtual;separate digital IM and verbal IM;mixed;digital;ecologically valid setting;low;temporal domain time;['memory', 'executive function'];['respiration', 'Fermi questions']

We examined the relation between cardiovascular synchronization, self-reported flow, and performance in a three-person online gaming task. We included measures of Heart Rate (HR), Pre-Ejection Period (PEP), and Cardiac Output (CO) as indices of task engagement and challenge (vs. threat) motivation. Group members were identifiable (i.e., visible) or anonymous during the game. Results indicated that PEP (as a marker of task engagement) and within-group synchronization in PEP, predicted flow, and that synchronization in PEP mediated the relation between group performance and experienced flow.

Design thinking practitioners and educators have adopted the concepts of interpersonal closeness and developed priming activities to propel subsequent creative-innovation tasks. In recent years, it has become paramount that these activities are effective in in-person and virtual (Zoom®) interaction settings. In this chapter, we present a design thinking (DT) activity to increase interpersonal closeness in in-person and virtual teams. We derived the DT activity from a Nonviolent Communication exercise frequently used to increase interpersonal closeness between individuals. In an empirical study (N = 72 participants, N = 36 dyads), we assessed whether the DT activity increased interpersonal closeness compared to two control tasks (i.e., a problem-solving and a creative-innovation task). Dyad partners engaged in either an in-person or virtual interaction group throughout the experiment (between-subject design). We also captured inter-brain signatures between dyad partners with portable functional near-infrared spectroscopy neuroimaging during the entire study. Results show that the DT activity increased interpersonal closeness in the in-person and virtual groups compared to the control tasks. We identified a distinct inter-brain signature in the right frontocortical region linked to the DT activity. Notably, this inter-brain signature differed between in-person and virtual groups. This finding suggests that conducting the DT activity in person may be more conducive to this prosocial inter-brain coherence pattern than the virtual interaction setting. Finally, preliminary results (N = 12 dyads) suggest that the DT activity increased performance in a subsequent creative-innovation task. Future research needs to confirm this hypothesis.;balters2023primingactivit;False;duplicate of Balters et al.

However, it remains unclear whether interbrain synchrony (IBS) is functionally relevant for social interaction or stems from exposure of individual brains to identical sensorimotor information. To disentangle these views, the current dual-EEG study investigated amplitude-based IBS in pianists jointly performing duets containing a silent pause followed by a tempo change. First, we manipulated the similarity of the anticipated tempo change and measured IBS during the pause, hence, capturing the alignment of purely endogenous, temporal plans without sound or movement. Notably, right posterior gamma IBS was higher when partners planned similar tempi, it predicted whether partners' tempi matched after the pause, and it was modulated only in real, not in surrogate pairs. Second, we manipulated the familiarity with the partner's actions and measured IBS during joint performance with sound. Although sensorimotor information was similar across conditions, gamma IBS was higher when partners were unfamiliar with each other's part and had to attend more closely to the sound of the performance. These combined findings demonstrate that IBS is not merely an epiphenomenon of shared sensorimotor information but can also hinge on endogenous, cognitive processes crucial for behavioral synchrony and successful social interaction. © 2022 The Author(s).

Little is known about the neural and inter-brain correlates of expressing appreciation and the potential effects of virtual videoconferencing on this kind of interaction. Here, we assess inter-brain coherence with functional near-infrared spectroscopy while dyads expressed appreciation to one another. We scanned 36 dyads (72 participants) who interacted in either an in-person or virtual (Zoom®) condition. Participants reported on their subjective experience of interpersonal closeness. As predicted, expressing appreciation increased interpersonal closeness between dyad partners. Relative to 3 other cooperation tasks (i.e. problem-solving task, creative-innovation task, socio-emotional task), we observed increased inter-brain coherence in socio-cognitive areas of the cortex (anterior frontopolar area, inferior frontal gyrus, premotor cortex, middle temporal gyrus, supramarginal gyrus, and visual association cortex) during the appreciation task. Increased inter-brain coherence in socio-cognitive areas during the appreciation task was associated with increased interpersonal closeness. These findings support the perspective that expressing appreciation, both in-person and virtually, increases subjective and neural metrics of interpersonal closeness. © The Author(s) 2023.

Despite the rise in the number of studies that investigate synchrony in naturalistic contexts, the use of varying methodological approaches to compute synchrony remains a central problem. When dyads engage in unstructured social interactions, the wide range of behavioural cues they display contribute to the use of varying lengths of signals to compute synchrony. The present functional Near-infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) study investigates how different methods to quantify brain signals during joint and non-joint portions of dyadic play affect the outcome of brain-to-brain synchrony. Three strategies to cope with unstructured data are tested and different signal lengths of 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45s were used to determine the optimal method to sensitively capture synchrony. Results showed that using all available portions of the signals generated a greater number of less conservative results compared to the other two strategies, which were to compute the average synchrony for the joint and non-joint signals portions and to compute the difference between the average synchrony of joint and non-joint portions. From the different signal durations, only length portions of 25s to 35s generated significant results. These findings demonstrate that differences in computational approaches and signal lengths affect synchrony measurements and should be considered in naturalistic synchrony studies.;bizzego2022assessingcompu;False;Population | >= 2 clinically healthy adult participants that are interacting and scanned simultaneously;fNIRS;within-subjects;31;['children', 'healthy adults'];dyad;['ff', 'fm'];parent-child;SBS;shared physical IM and verbal IM;open-ended;analog;ecologically valid setting;high;['connectivity functional'];social cognition;['wavelet transform coherence', 'fNIRS channel number: 20']

In operational environments, human interaction and cooperation between individuals are critical to efficiency and safety. These states are influenced by individuals' cognitive and emotional states. Human factor research aims to objectively quantify these states to prevent human error and maintain constant performances, particularly in high-risk settings such as aviation, where human error and performance account for a significant portion of accidents.
Methods
Thus, this study aimed to evaluate and validate two novel methods for assessing the degree of cooperation among professional pilots engaged in real-flight simulation tasks. In addition, the study aimed to assess the ability of the proposed metrics to differentiate between the expertise levels of operating crews based on their levels of cooperation. Eight crews were involved in the experiments, consisting of four crews of Unexperienced pilots and four crews of Experienced pilots. An expert trainer, simulating air traffic management communication on one side and acting as a subject matter expert on the other, provided external evaluations of the pilots' mental states during the simulation. The two novel approaches introduced in this study were formulated based on circular correlation and mutual information techniques.
Results and discussion
The findings demonstrated the possibility of quantifying cooperation levels among pilots during realistic flight simulations. In addition, cooperation time is found to be significantly higher (p < 0.05) among Experienced pilots compared to Unexperienced ones. Furthermore, these preliminary results exhibited significant correlations (p < 0.05) with subjective and behavioral measures collected every 30 s during the task, confirming their reliability.";capotorto2024cooperationobj;False;Study Design | Collaborative scenario with >= 1 remote interaction manipulative ([virtually] separated during interaction);['EEG'];['between-subjects'];16;['healthy adults'];['dyad'];['n/s'];['n/s'];['SBS'];['shared physical IM and verbal IM'];['mixed'];['analog'];['ecologically valid setting'];['high'];['temporal domain frequency', 'connectivity functional'];['executive function', 'visuospatial cognition', 'motor'];['EEG electrode number: 8', 'MI-Cooperation Index', ' pilot task', ' approach-withdrawal', ' mental workload']

Although previous studies have explored gaze behaviors and neural mechanisms underlying in-person eye contact, the growing prevalence of remote communication has raised questions about how to establish mutual gaze remotely and how the brains of interacting individuals synchronize. Methods: To address these questions, we conducted a study using eye trackers to create a pseudo-mutual gaze channel that mirrors the gazes of each interacting dyad on their respective remote screens. To demonstrate fluctuations in coupling across brains, we incorporated electroencephalographic hyperscanning techniques to simultaneously record the brain activity of interacting dyads engaged in a joint attention task in player-observer, collaborative, and competitive modes. Results: Our results indicated that mutual gaze could improve the efficiency of joint attention activities among remote partners. Moreover, by employing the phase locking value, we could estimate interbrain synchrony (IBS) and observe low-frequency couplings in the frontal and temporal regions that varied based on the interaction mode. While dyadic gender composition significantly affected gaze patterns, it did not impact the IBS. Conclusion: These results provide insight into the neurological mechanisms underlying remote interaction through the pseudo-mutual gaze channel and have significant implications for developing effective online communication environments. © 2023 The Authors.

Such interaction typically involves two key elements: shared goal and action coordination. Yet, the substrates entrained to these two components in joint action remained unclear. In the current study, dyads performed two tasks involving both sharing goal and action coordination, i.e. complementary joint action and imitative joint action, a task only involving shared goal and a task only involving action coordination, while their brain activities were recorded by the functional near-infrared spectroscopy hyperscanning technique. The results showed that both complementary and imitative joint action (i.e. involving shared goal and action coordination) elicited better behavioral performance than the task only involving shared goal/action coordination. We observed that the interbrain synchronization (IBS) at the right inferior frontal cortex (IFC) entrained more to shared goal, while left-IFC IBS entrained more to action coordination. We also observed that the right-IFC IBS was greater during completing a complementary action than an imitative action. Our results suggest that IFC plays an important role in joint action, with distinct lateralization for the sub-components of joint action. © The Author(s) 2022.

In terms of group dynamics as an important indicator of collaboration quality, extant studies have shown the benefits of synchrony between learners ` actions during collaborative learning processes. However, synchrony of learners ` cognitive processes and visual attention in collaborative maker activities remains under-explored. Leveraging the multimodal learning analytics (MMLA) approach, this pilot study examines learners ` synchrony patterns from multiple modalities of data in the collaborative maker activity of virtual reality (VR) content creation. We conducted a user experiment with five pairs of students, and collected and analyzed their electroencephalography (EEG) signals, eye movement and system log data. Results showed that the five pairs of collaborators demonstrated diverse synchrony patterns. We also discovered that, while some groups exhibited synchrony in one modality of data before becoming not synchronized in another modality, other groups started with a lack of synchrony followed by maintaining synchrony. This study is expected to make methodological and practical contributions to MMLA research and assessment of collaborative maker activities.;wang2024unveilingsynch;True;;['EEG', 'Eye-tracking'];within-subjects;10;healthy adults;dyad;n/s;n/s;virtual;separate digital IM w/out verbal IM;open-ended;digital;ecologically valid setting;high;['temporal domain time', 'connectivity functional'];executive function;['EEG electrode number: 24', 'VR', 'learning', 'mbt Wireless EEG', 'Pupil-Lab eye tracker']

This study investigated collective performance within two collaborative environments (co-located and distancing settings) by assessing inter-brain synchrony patterns (IBS) among design collaborators using functional nearinfrared spectroscopy. The preliminary study was conducted with three dyads who possessed 2–3 years of professional product design experience. Each dyad completed two designated design tasks in distinct settings. In the distributed condition, participants interacted through video conferencing in which they were allowed to communicate by verbalization and sketching using a shared digital whiteboard. To prevent the influences of different sketching tools on design outputs, we employed digital sketching for both environments. The interactions between collaborators were identified in three behaviors: verbal only, sketch only, and mixed communication (verbal and sketch). The consequences revealed a higher level of IBS when mixed communication took place in distributed conditions than in co-located conditions. Comparably, the occurrence of IBS increased when participants solely utilized sketching as the interaction approach within the co-located setting. A mixed communication method combining verbalization and sketching might lead to more coordinated cognitive processes when in physical isolation. Design collaborators are inclined to adjust their interaction behaviors in order to adapt to different design environments, strengthen the exchange of ideas, and construct design consensus. Overall, the present paper discussed the performance of virtual collaborative design based on a neurocognitive perspective, contributing valuable insights for the future intervention design that promotes effective virtual teamwork.;shih2024theeffectsofdi;True;;['fNIRS', 'camera-based tracking'];within-subjects;6;healthy adults;dyad;['ff', 'fm', 'mm'];familiar;['SBS', 'virtual'];['separate digital IM and verbal IM', 'separate digital IM w/out verbal IM'];open-ended;mixed;ecologically valid setting;high;temporal domain time;['other', 'executive function'];['fNIRS channel number: 8', 'screen', 'design task']

In this pilot study (N=24), we examined how the addition of visual displays of heart rate (HR) signals afected players' gameplay in a six-player version of Mafa in online and in-person settings. We also examined moments of synchrony in HR data during critical moments of gameplay. We fnd that seeing signals did afect players' strategies and infuenced their gameplay, and that there were moments of HR synchrony during vital game events. These results suggest that HR, when available, is used by players in making game decisions, and that players' HR can be a measure of like-minded player decisions.

The purpose of this research was to identify contributors to PBC; examine relationships between PBC, team performance, and perceived team attributes (e.g., cohesion, trust); and compare a set of time-series measures(cross-correlation [CC], cross-recurrence quantification analysis [CRQA], and cross-fuzzy entropy [CFEn]) in their characterization of PBC across comparisons. To accomplish this, PBC was examined in human postural sway (PS) and cardiac interbeat intervals (IBIs) from dyadic teams performing a fast-paced puzzle task (Quadra-a variant of the video game Tetris). Results indicated that observed levels of PBC were not a chance occurrence, but instead driven by features of the team-task environment, and that PBC was likely influenced by similar individual task demands and interpersonal coordination dynamics that were not ""unique"" to a particular team. Correlation analysis revealed that PBC exhibited negative relationships with team performance and team attributes, which were interpreted to reflect complementary coordination (as opposed to mimicry) during task performance, potentially due to differentiated team roles. Finally, qualitative comparison of timeseries measures used to characterize PBC indicated that CRQA percent recurrence and CFEn (both nonlinear measures) settled on mostly analogous characterizations, whereas linear CC did not. The disparity observed between the linear and nonlinear measures highlights underlying computational and interpretational differences between the two families of statistics and supports the use of multiple metrics for characterizing PBC. © 2013 American Psychological Association.";strang2014physiobehavior;True;;ECG;within-subjects;80;healthy adults;dyad;['ff', 'mm'];unfamiliar;FTF;separate digital IM w/out verbal IM;goal-driven;digital;cooperation/competition tasks;low;['temporal domain time', 'connectivity functional'];['executive function', 'visuospatial cognition'];['Tetris task', 'IBI coupling', 'postural sway']

In the present study, dyads of participants were instructed to coordinate their key presses to move a cursor up to a specific target (i.e., to achieve a common goal). We applied random deviations on the cursor's trajectory to manipulate the motor fluency of the joint action, while the agents’ motor roles were either balanced (i.e., equivalent) or unbalanced (i.e., one agent contributed more than the other), making the agents more or less pivotal to the joint action. Then, the final outcomes were shared equally, fairly (i.e., reflecting individual motor contributions) or arbitrarily in an all-or-none fashion, between the co-agents. Self and joint SoA were measured through self-reports about feeling of control, that is, using judgment of (felt) control (JoC), and electrodermal activity was recorded during the whole motor task. We observed that self and joint JoC were reduced in the case of low motor fluency, pointing out the importance of sensorimotor cues for both I- and we-modes. Moreover, while self JoC was reduced in the low pivotality condition (i.e., low motor role), joint JoC was significantly enhanced when agents’ roles and rewards were symmetrical (i.e. equal). Skin conductance responses to rewards were impacted by the way outcomes were shared between partners (i.e., fairly, equally or arbitrarily) but not by the individual gains, which demonstrates the sensitivity of low-level physiological reactions to external signs of fairness. Skin conductance level was also reduced in the fair context, where rewards were shared according to individual motor contributions, relative to the all-or-none context, which could mirror the feeling of effective responsibility and control over actions’ outcomes. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.;lebars2020agentspivotali;True;;EDA;within-subjects;35;healthy adults;dyad;['ff', 'mm'];unfamiliar;SBS v-b;separate digital IM w/out verbal IM;goal-driven;digital;cooperation/competition tasks;low;temporal domain time;['executive function', 'visuospatial cognition'];['self-report', 'SoA (Sense of Agency)']

Poeppel, David";2021;Crowdsourcing neuroscience: Inter-brain coupling during face-to-face interactions outside the laboratory;When we feel connected or engaged during social behavior, are our brains in fact “in sync” in a formal, quantifiable sense? Most studies addressing this question use highly controlled tasks with homogenous subject pools. In an effort to take a more naturalistic approach, we collaborated with art institutions to crowdsource neuroscience data: Over the course of 5 years, we collected electroencephalogram (EEG) data from thousands of museum and festival visitors who volunteered to engage in a 10-min face-to-face interaction. Pairs of participants with various levels of familiarity sat inside the Mutual Wave Machine—an artistic neurofeedback installation that translates real-time correlations of each pair's EEG activity into light patterns. Because such inter-participant EEG correlations are prone to noise contamination, in subsequent offline analyses we computed inter-brain coupling using Imaginary Coherence and Projected Power Correlations, two synchrony metrics that are largely immune to instantaneous, noise-driven correlations. When applying these methods to two subsets of recorded data with the most consistent protocols, we found that pairs’ trait empathy, social closeness, engagement, and social behavior (joint action and eye contact) consistently predicted the extent to which their brain activity became synchronized, most prominently in low alpha (~7–10 Hz) and beta (~20–22 Hz) oscillations. These findings support an account where shared engagement and joint action drive coupled neural activity and behavior during dynamic, naturalistic social interactions. To our knowledge, this work constitutes a first demonstration that an interdisciplinary, real-world, crowdsourcing neuroscience approach may provide a promising method to collect large, rich datasets pertaining to real-life face-to-face interactions. Additionally, it is a demonstration of how the general public can participate and engage in the scientific process outside of the laboratory. Institutions such as museums, galleries, or any other organization where the public actively engages out of self-motivation, can help facilitate this type of citizen science research, and support the collection of large datasets under scientifically controlled experimental conditions.

In this study, we adopted a 2 ​PN approach and a multiple-brain connectivity model to investigate the neural basis of a form of cooperation called joint action. We hypothesized different intra-brain and inter-brain connectivity patterns when comparing the interpersonal properties of joint action with non-interpersonal conditions, with a focus on co-representation, a core ability at the basis of cooperation. 32 subjects were enrolled in dual-EEG recordings during a computerized joint action task including three conditions: one in which the dyad jointly acted to pursue a common goal (joint), one in which each subject interacted with the PC (PC), and one in which each subject performed the task individually (Solo). A combination of multiple-brain connectivity estimation and specific indices derived from graph theory allowed to compare interpersonal with non-interpersonal conditions in four different frequency bands. Our results indicate that all the indices were modulated by the interaction, and returned a significantly stronger integration of multiple-subject networks in the joint vs. PC and Solo conditions. A subsequent classification analysis showed that features based on multiple-brain indices led to a better discrimination between social and non-social conditions with respect to single-subject indices. Taken together, our results suggest that multiple-brain connectivity can provide a deeper insight into the understanding of the neural basis of cooperation in humans. © 2020 The Authors;astolfi2020raisingthebarc;True;;EEG;within-subjects;32;healthy adults;dyad;mm;unfamiliar;FTF v-b;separate digital IM w/out verbal IM;goal-driven;digital;cooperation/competition tasks;high;connectivity functional;visuospatial cognition;['EEG electrode number: 61', 'graph theory']

Successful human-agent teams leverage the computational power and sensory capabilities of automated agents while keeping the human operator's expectation consistent with the agent's ability. This helps prevent over-reliance on and under-utilization of the agent to optimize its effectiveness. Research at the intersection of human-computer interaction, social psychology, and neuroergonomics has identified trust as a governing factor of human-agent interactions that can be modulated to maintain an appropriate expectation. To achieve this calibration, trust can be monitored continuously and unobtrusively using neurophysiological sensors. While prior studies have demonstrated the potential of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), a lightweight neuroimaging technology, in the prediction of social, cognitive, and affective states, few have successfully used it to measure complex social constructs like trust in artificial agents. Even fewer studies have examined the dynamics of hybrid teams of more than 1 human or 1 agent. We address this gap by developing a highly collaborative task that requires knowledge sharing within teams of 2 humans and 1 agent. Using brain data obtained with fNIRS sensors, we aim to identify brain regions sensitive to changes in agent behavior on a long- and short-term scale. We manipulated agent reliability and transparency while measuring trust, mental demand, team processes, and affect. Transparency and reliability levels are found to significantly affect trust in the agent, while transparency explanations do not impact mental demand. Reducing agent communication is shown to disrupt interpersonal trust and team cohesion, suggesting similar dynamics as human-human teams. Contrasts of General Linear Model analyses identify dorsal medial prefrontal cortex activation specific to assessing the agent's transparency explanations and characterize increases in mental demand as signaled by dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex and frontopolar activation. Short scale event-level data is analyzed to show that predicting whether an individual will trust the agent, with data from 15 s before their decision, is feasible with fNIRS data. Discussing our results, we identify targets and directions for future neuroergonomics research as a step toward building an intelligent trust-modulation system to optimize human-agent collaborations in real time.

We compared neurophysiological measures within the frequency domain (delta, theta, alpha, and beta EEG bands) in the two conditions: face-toface and remote settings. Data collection was carried out using wearable EEG systems. Conversational analysis was previously applied to detect comparable EEG time blocks and semantic topics. The digitalization of training can be considered a challenge but also a chance for organizations. However, if not carefully addressed, it might constitute a criticality. Limited research explored how remote, as opposed to face-to-face, training affects cognitive, (such as memory and attention), affective, and social processes in workgroups. Data showed an alpha desynchronization and, conversely, a theta and beta synchronization for the face-to-face condition. Moreover, trainees showed different patterns for beta power depending on the setting condition, with significantly increased power spectral density (PSD) in the face-to-face condition. These results highlight the relevance of neurophysiological measures in testing the e-learning process, in relation to the emotional engagement, memory encoding, and attentional processing.;balconi2023hyperscanninge;True;;EEG;between-subjects;8;healthy adults;more (n_group = 8);n/s;instructor-student;['FTF', 'virtual'];['shared physical IM and verbal IM', 'separate digital IM and verbal IM'];open-ended;mixed;ecologically valid setting;high;temporal domain frequency;['social cognition', 'executive function'];['EEG electrode number: 4', 'memory',  'screen', 'learning', 'attention', 'Muse Headband version 2']

Mounting evidence from recent hyperscanning neuroimaging studies indicates that key components of social behavior can be evaluated using inter-brain oscillations and connectivity. However, mapping out inter-brain networks and developing neurocognitive theories that explain how humans co-create and share information during social interaction remains challenging. In this study, we developed a jigsaw puzzle-solving game with hyperscanning electroencephalography (EEG) signals recorded to investigate inter-brain activities during social interactions involving cooperation and competition. Participants were recruited and paired into dyads to participate in the multiplayer jigsaw puzzle game with 32-channel EEG signals recorded. The corresponding event-related potentials (ERPs), brain oscillations, and inter-brain functional connectivity were analyzed. The results showed different ERP morphologies of P3 patterns in competitive and cooperative contexts, and brain oscillations in the low-frequency band may be an indicator of social cognitive activities. Furthermore, increased inter-brain functional connectivity in the delta, theta, alpha, and beta frequency bands was observed in the competition mode compared to the cooperation mode. By presenting comparable and valid hyperscanning EEG results alongside those of previous studies using traditional paradigms, this study demonstrates the potential of utilizing hyperscanning techniques in real-life game-playing scenarios to quantitatively assess social cognitive interactions involving cooperation and competition. Our approach offers a promising platform with potential applications in the flexible assessment of psychiatric disorders related to social functioning. © 2001-2011 IEEE.;chuang2024exploringinter;True;;EEG;within-subjects;58;healthy adults;dyad;['ff', 'fm', 'mm'];n/s;virtual;separate digital IM w/out verbal IM;goal-driven;digital;cooperation/competition tasks;high;['connectivity functional', 'temporal domain frequency'];['memory', 'visuospatial cognition'];['EEG electrode number: 32']

This requires the involvement of two complex brain systems: the mirror neuron system (MNS) and the mentalizing system (MENT), both of critical importance for successful social interaction. However, their internal organization and the potential synergy of both systems during joint actions (JA) are yet to be determined. The aim of this study was to examine the role and interaction of these two fundamental systems—MENT and MNS—during continuous interaction. To this hand, we conducted a multiple-brain connectivity analysis in the source domain during a motor cooperation task using high-density EEG dual-recordings providing relevant insights into the roles of MNS and MENT at the intra- and interbrain levels. In particular, the intra-brain analysis demonstrated the essential function of both systems during JA, as well as the crucial role played by single brain regions of both neural mechanisms during cooperative activities. Specifically, our intra-brain analysis revealed that both neural mechanisms are essential during Joint Action (JA), showing a solid connection between MNS and MENT and a central role of the single brain regions of both mechanisms during cooperative actions. Additionally, our inter-brain study revealed increased inter-subject connections involving the motor system, MENT and MNS. Thus, our findings show a mutual influence between two interacting agents, based on synchronization of MNS and MENT systems. Our results actually encourage more research into the still-largely unknown realm of inter-brain dynamics and contribute to expand the body of knowledge in social neuroscience. © 2024;ciaramidaro2024synergyofthemi;True;;EEG;within-subjects;32;healthy adults;dyad;mm;n/s;SBS;shared digital IM w/out verbal IM;goal-driven;digital;coordination tasks;high;['spatial domain source', 'connectivity functional', 'temporal domain frequency'];['motor', 'visuospatial cognition'];['EEG electrode number: 61']

However, little is known regarding the neural basis of two or more individuals engaging cooperatively in real-world tasks, such as in operational training environments. In this exploratory study, we recruited forty individuals paired as twenty dyads and recorded dual-EEG at rest and during realistic training scenarios of increasing complexity using virtual simulation systems. We estimated markers of intrinsic brain activity (i.e., individual alpha frequency and aperiodic activity), as well as task-related theta and alpha oscillations. Using nonlinear modelling and a logistic regression machine learning model, we found that resting-state EEG predicts performance and can also reliably differentiate between members within a dyad. Task-related theta and alpha activity during easy training tasks predicted later performance on complex training to a greater extent than prior behaviour. These findings complement laboratory-based research on both oscillatory and aperiodic activity in higher-order cognition and provide evidence that theta and alpha activity play a critical role in complex task performance in team environments.;cross2022taskrelatedint;True;;EEG;within-subjects;40;healthy adults;dyad;['fm', 'mm'];n/s;['SBS', 'virtual'];['shared physical IM and verbal IM', 'separate digital IM and verbal IM'];goal-driven;mixed;ecologically valid setting;low;['temporal domain time', 'connectivity functional', 'temporal domain frequency'];['motor', 'executive function'];['AR', 'learning', 'EEG electrode number: 32']

To this end, we designed a novel group drumming task in which participants matched their drumming to either predictable or unpredictable tempos. Fifty-one three-person groups were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: synchronized or asynchronized drumming. Outcome measures included electrocardiograms and self-reports of group cohesion and synchrony. The drumming task elicited an increase in physiological synchrony between group members (specifically their hearts’ interbeat intervals). We also found that physiological synchronization and behavioral synchronization predicted individuals’ experience of group cohesion. Physiological synchrony also predicted performance in a subsequent group task that involved freely drumming together. The findings suggest that the behavioral and physiological consequences of synchronization contribute to the formation of group bonds and coordination. They also confirm that insights from translational social neuroscience can inform our knowledge of the development of cohesive and efficacious groups.;gordon2020physiologicala;False;submission after publication;['ECG'];['between-subjects'];141;['healthy adults'];['triad'];['n/s'];['familiar', 'unfamiliar'];['FTF'];['physical IM w/out verbal IM'];['goal-driven'];['analog'];['coordination tasks'];['high'];['connectivity functional'];['motor'];['drumming task']

Moreover, the level of BS at the problem-solving stage was significantly correlated with task performance. Groups with all high CPS skill students had the highest level of BS, while some of the mixed groups could achieve the same level of BS. BS is an effective indicator of CPS to group performance and individual interaction.

By defining individual tasks, these roles dictate processing demands of the collaborators. The main aim of the present study was to examine the hypothesis that induced alpha and lower beta oscillations provide insights into affective and cognitive brain states during social cooperation. Toward this end, an experimental game was used in which participants had to navigate a Pacman figure through a maze by sending and receiving information about the correct moving direction. Supporting our hypotheses, individual roles taken by the collaborators during gameplay were associated with significant changes in alpha and lower beta power. Furthermore, effects were similar when participants played the Pacman Game with human or computer partners. Findings are discussed from the perspective of the information-via-desynchronization hypothesis proposing that alpha and lower beta power decreases reflect states of enhanced cortical information representation.

Järvelä, Sanna";2022;The pivotal role of monitoring for collaborative problem solving seen in interaction, performance, and interpersonal physiology;Being aware of the progress towards one’s goals is considered one of the main characteristics of the self-regulation process. This is also the case for collaborative problem solving, which invites group members to metacognitively monitor the progress with their goals and externalize it in social interactions while solving a problem. Monitoring challenges can activate group members to control the situation together, which can be seen as adjustments on different systemic levels (physiological, psychological, and interpersonal) of a collaborative group. This study examines how the pivotal role of monitoring for collaborative problem solving is reflected in interactions, performance, and interpersonal physiology. The study has foci in two central characteristics of monitoring interactions that facilitate groups’ regulation in reaching their goals. First is valence of monitoring, indicating whether the group members think they are progressing towards their goal or not. Second is equality of participation in monitoring interactions between group members. Participants of the study were volunteering higher education students (N = 57), randomly assigned to groups of three members whose collaborative task was to learn to run a business simulation. The collaborative task was video recorded, and the physiological arousal of each participant was recorded from their electrodermal activity. The results of the study suggest that both the valence and equality of participation are identifiable in monitoring interactions and they both positively predict groups’ performance in the task. Equality of participation to monitoring was not related to the interpersonal physiology. However, valence of monitoring was related to interpersonal physiology in terms of physiological synchrony and arousal. The findings support the view that characteristics of monitoring interactions make a difference to task performance in collaborative problem solving and that interpersonal physiology relates to these characteristics.;haataja2022thepivotalrole;False;Study Design | Collaborative scenario with >= 1 remote interaction manipulative ([virtually] separated during interaction);['EDA', 'camera-based tracking'];within-subjects;57;['healthy adults'];['triad'];fm;['unfamiliar'];n/s;['shared digital IM and verbal IM'];['mixed'];['analog'];['ecologically valid setting'];high;['connectivity functional', 'temporal domain time'];['executive function'];['collaborative problem solving', 'emotional valence']

Yet, cooperative tasks typically require people to constantly take and switch individual roles. Task relevance is dictated by these roles and thereby dynamically changing. Here, we designed a dyadic game to test whether the family of P3 components can trace this dynamic allocation of task relevance. We demonstrate that late positive event-related potential (ERP) modulations not only reflect predictable asymmetries between receiving and sending information but also differentiate whether the receiver's role is related to correct decision making or action monitoring. Furthermore, similar results were observed when playing the game with a computer, suggesting that experimental games may motivate humans to similarly cooperate with an artificial agent. Overall, late positive ERP waves provide a real-time measure of how role taking dynamically shapes the meaning and relevance of stimuli within collaborative contexts. Our results, therefore, shed light on how the processes of mutual coordination unfold during dyadic cooperation.;floesch2024dyadiccooperat;True;;EEG;within-subjects;24;healthy adults;dyad;['ff', 'mm'];familiar;virtual;separate digital IM w/out verbal IM;goal-driven;digital;cooperation/competition tasks;high;temporal domain time;['memory', 'language', 'social cognition', 'executive function'];['EEG electrode number: 128']

However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no study that has used hyperscanning in Virtual Reality (VR). The aims of this study were; firstly, to replicate results of inter-brain synchrony reported in existing literature for a real world task and secondly, to explore whether the inter-brain synchrony could be elicited in a Virtual Environment (VE). This paper reports on three pilot-studies in two different settings (real-world and VR). Paired participants performed two sessions of a finger-pointing exercise separated by a finger-tracking exercise during which their neural activity was simultaneously recorded by electroencephalography (EEG) hardware. By using phase locking value (PLV) analysis, VR was found to induce similar inter-brain synchrony as seen in the real-world. Further, it was observed that the finger-pointing exercise shared the same neurally activated area in both the real-world and VR. Based on these results, we infer that VR can be used to enhance inter-brain synchrony in collaborative tasks carried out in a VE. In particular, we have been able to demonstrate that changing visual perspective in VR is capable of eliciting inter-brain synchrony. This demonstrates that VR could be an exciting platform to explore the phenomena of inter-brain synchrony further and provide a deeper understanding of the neuroscience of human communication.

Here, individual and dyadic differences have been found to yield a range of dyadic synchronization strategies, such as mutual adaptation, leading-leading, and leading-following behaviour, but the brain mechanisms that underlie these strategies remain poorly understood. To identify individual brain mechanisms underlying emergence of these minimal social interaction strategies, we contrasted EEG-recorded brain activity in two groups of musicians exhibiting the mutual adaptation and leading-leading strategies. We found that the individuals coordinating via mutual adaptation exhibited a more frequent occurrence of phase-locked activity within a transient action-perception-related brain network in the alpha range, as compared to the leading-leading group. Furthermore, we identified parietal and temporal brain regions that changed significantly in the directionality of their within-network information flow. Our results suggest that the stronger weight on extrinsic coupling observed in computational models of mutual adaptation as compared to leading-leading might be facilitated by a higher degree of action-perception network coupling in the brain. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

The interactive brain hypothesis proposes that interactive social cues are processed by dedicated brain substrates and provides a general theoretical framework for investigating the underlying neural mechanisms of social interaction. We test the specific case of this hypothesis proposing that canonical language areas are upregulated and dynamically coupled across brains during social interactions based on talking and listening. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) was employed to acquire simultaneous deoxyhemoglobin (deOxyHb) signals of the brain on partners who alternated between speaking and listening while doing an Object Naming & Description task with and without interaction in a natural setting. Comparison of interactive and non-interactive conditions confirmed an increase in neural activity associated with Wernicke's area including the superior temporal gyrus (STG) during interaction (P = 0.04). However, the hypothesis was not supported for Broca's area. Cross-brain coherence determined by wavelet analyses of signals originating from the STG and the subcentral area was greater during interaction than non-interaction (P < 0.01). In support of the interactive brain hypothesis these findings suggest a dynamically coupled cross-brain neural mechanism dedicated to pathways that share interpersonal information. © The Author(s) 2018.;hirsch2018acrossbrainneu;False;Study Design | Collaborative scenario with >= 1 remote interaction manipulative ([virtually] separated during interaction);fNIRS;within-subjects;62;healthy adults;dyad;['ff', 'fm', 'mm'];unfamiliar;FTF v-b;separate digital IM and verbal IM;goal-driven;digital;not applicable;low;['spatial domain source', 'connectivity functional'];language;['fNIRS channel number: 42']

Previous studies have revealed two directions of group polarization, i.e., risky shift and cautious shift, but how group of brains drive these shifts remains unknown. In the current study, we arranged risk advantage and disadvantage situations to elicit group polarization of risky shift and cautious shift respectively, and examined the averaged inter-brain synchronization (ABS) among participant triads during group decision making versus individual decision making. The elicited group polarizations were accompanied by the enhanced ABS at bilateral prefrontal areas and left temporoparietal junction (TPJ). Specifically, the TPJ ABS was equivalent in risky shift and cautious shift, and based on machine learning analyses, could predict the extent of group polarization; for two shifts, it negatively correlated with negative emotion. However, the right prefrontal ABS was stronger in risky shift than in cautious shift, and the same area showed the larger brain deactivation in former shift, indicating weaker executive control. For the left prefrontal ABS, only the equivalent ABS was found for two shifts. In sum, group polarization of risky shift and cautious shift calls for inter-brain communication at the group level, and the former shift is with deactivation and more brain synchronization. Our study suggests emotional and cognitive adjustment in decision making of the group compared with individuals. © 2022 The Author(s)";hou2022grouppolarizat;False;Study Design | Collaborative scenario with >= 1 remote interaction manipulative ([virtually] separated during interaction);fNIRS;within-subjects;57;healthy adults;triad;ff;unfamiliar;FTF;['separate digital IM and verbal IM', 'separate digital IM w/out verbal IM'];goal-driven;mixed;cooperation/competition tasks;high;['connectivity functional', 'temporal domain frequency', 'spatial domain sensor'];executive function;['wavelet transform coherence']

Synchrony has been investigated in both behavioral and biological frameworks. While it has been demonstrated that adversity can influence behavioral parent-child synchrony, the neural mechanisms by which this disruption occurs are understudied. The current study examined the association between adversity, parent-child behavioral synchrony, and parent-child neural synchrony across lateral prefrontal cortical regions using functional near-infrared spectroscopy hyperscanning during a parent-child interaction task that included a mild stress induction followed by a recovery period. Participants included 115 children (ages 4-5) and their primary caregivers. Parent-child behavioral synchrony was quantified as the amount time the dyad was synchronous (e.g., reciprocal communication, coordinated behaviors) during the interaction task. Parent-child neural synchrony was examined as the hemodynamic concordance between parent and child lateral PFC activation. Adversity was examined across two, empirically-derived domains: sociodemographic risk (e.g., family income) and familial risk (e.g., household chaos).

An analysis of brain responses using electroencephalography and hyperscanning;Collaboration between two individuals is thought to be associated with the synchrony of two different brain activities. Indeed, prefrontal cortical activation and alpha frequency band modulation has been widely reported, but little is known about interbrain synchrony (IBS) changes occurring during social interaction such as collaboration or competition. In this study, we assess the dynamic of IBS variation in order to provide novel insights into the frequency band modulation underlying collaboration. To address this question, we used electroencephalography (EEG) to simultaneously record the brain activity of two individuals playing a computer-based game facing four different conditions: collaboration, competition, single participation, and passive observation. The computer-based game consisted of a fast button response task. Using data recorded in sensor space, we calculated an IBS value for each frequency band using both wavelet coherence transform and phase-locking value and performed single-subject analysis to compare each condition. We found significant IBS in frontal electrodes only present during collaboration associated with alpha frequency band modulation. In addition, we observed significant IBS in the theta frequency band for both collaboration and competition conditions, along with a significant single-subject cortical activity. Competition is distinguishable through single-subject activity in several regions and frequency bands of the brain. Performance is correlated with single-subject frontal activation during collaboration in the alpha and beta frequency band. © 2021 The Authors.

Multilayer network-based inter-brain synchrony approach;Social interaction plays a crucial role in human societies, encompassing complex dynamics among individuals. To understand social interaction at the neural level, researchers have utilized hyperscanning in several social settings. These studies have mainly focused on inter-brain synchrony and the efficiency of paired functional brain networks, examining group interactions in dyads. However, this approach may not fully capture the complexity of multiple interactions, potentially leading to gaps in understanding inter-network differences. To overcome this limitation, the present study aims to bridge this gap by introducing methodological enhancements using the multilayer network approach, which is tailored to extract features from multiple networks. We applied this strategy to analyze the triad condition during social behavior processes to identify group interaction indices. Additionally, to validate our methodology, we compared the multilayer networks of triad conditions with group synchrony to paired conditions without group synchrony, focusing on statistical differences between alpha and beta waves. Correlation analysis between inter-brain and group networks revealed that this methodology accurately reflects the characteristics of actual behavioral synchrony. The findings of our study suggest that measures of paired brain synchrony and group interaction may exhibit distinct trends, offering valuable insights into interpreting group synchrony. © The Author(s) 2025.

Neural substrates of on-line mutual eye-gaze: A hyperscanning fMRI study;Automatic mimicry is a critical element of social interaction. A salient type of automatic mimicry is eye contact characterized by sharing of affective and mental states among individuals. We conducted a hyperscanning functional magnetic resonance imaging study involving on-line (LIVE) and delayed off-line (REPLAY) conditions to test our hypothesis that recurrent interaction through eye contact activates the limbic mirror system, including the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and anterior insular cortex (AIC), both of which are critical for self-awareness. Sixteen pairs of human adults participated in the experiment. Given that an eye-blink represents an individual’s attentional window toward the partner, we analyzed pairwise time-series data for eye-blinks. We used multivariate autoregression analysis to calculate the noise contribution ratio (NCR) as an index of how a participant’s directional attention was influenced by that of their partner. NCR was greater in the LIVE than in the REPLAY condition, indicating mutual perceptual-motor interaction during real-time eye contact. Relative to the REPLAY condition, the LIVE condition was associated with greater activation in the left cerebellar hemisphere, vermis, and ACC, accompanied by enhanced functional connectivity between ACC and right AIC. Given the roles of the cerebellum in sensorimotor prediction and ACC in movement initiation, ACCcerebellar activation may represent their involvement in modulating visual input related to the partner’s movement, which may, in turn, involve the limbic mirror system. Our findings indicate that mutual interaction during eye contact is mediated by the cerebellum and limbic mirror system. © 2019 Koike et al.;koike2019whatmakeseyeco;False;Study Design | Collaborative scenario with >= 1 remote interaction manipulative ([virtually] separated during interaction);['other', 'Eye-tracking', 'camera-based tracking'];within-subjects;34;healthy adults;dyad;['ff', 'mm'];unfamiliar;virtual;non-verbal IM;open-ended;digital;eye-contact/gaze-based tasks;high;['other', 'temporal domain time', 'connectivity effective'];social cognition;['ACC', 'AIC', 'eye', 'fMRI', 'leader-follower', 'number of eye-blinks', 'eyes tracked with MRI cameras']

Cooperation and competition under different intergroup relationships: evidence from EEG hyperscanning;Cooperation and competition are the most common forms of social interaction in various social relationships. Intergroup relationships have been posited to influence individuals’ interpersonal interactions significantly. Using electroencephalography hyperscanning, this study aimed to establish whether intergroup relationships influence interpersonal cooperation and competition and the underlying neural mechanisms. According to the results, the in-group Coop-index is better than the out-group, whereas the out-group Comp-index is stronger than the in-group. The in-group functional connectivity between the frontal-central region and the right temporoparietal junction in the β band was stronger in competition than cooperation. The out-group functional connectivity between the frontal-central region and the left temporoparietal junction in the α band was stronger in cooperation than competition. In both cooperation and competition, the in-group exhibited higher interbrain synchronization between the prefrontal cortex and parietal region in the θ band, as well as between the frontal-central region and frontal-central region in the α band, compared to the out-group. The intrabrain phase-locking value in both the α and β bands can effectively predict performance in competition tasks. Interbrain phase-locking value in both the α and θ bands can be effectively predicted in a performance cooperation task. This study offers neuroscientific evidence for in-group favoritism and out-group bias at an interpersonal level. © The Author(s) 2024. Published by Oxford University Press.

As the origins of INS are poorly understood, we tested whether and how INS might emerge from spontaneous dyadic behavior. We recorded neural activity (EEG) and human behavior (full-body kinematics, eye movements, and facial expressions) while dyads of participants were instructed to look at each other without speaking or making co-verbal gestures. We made four fundamental observations. First, despite the absence of a structured social task, INS emerged spontaneously only when participants were able to see each other. Second, we show that such spontaneous INS, comprising specific spectral and topographic profiles, did not merely reflect intra-personal modulations of neural activity, but it rather reflected real-time and dyad-specific coupling of neural activities. Third, using state-of-art video-image processing and deep learning, we extracted the temporal unfolding of three notable social behavioral cues – body movement, eye contact, and smiling – and demonstrated that these behaviors also spontaneously synchronized within dyads. Fourth, we probed the correlates of INS in such synchronized social behaviors. Using cross-correlation and Granger causality analyses, we show that synchronized social behaviors anticipate and in fact Granger cause INS. These results provide proof-of-concept evidence for studying interpersonal neural and behavioral synchrony under natural and unconstrained conditions. Most importantly, the results suggest that INS could be conceptualized as an emergent property of two coupled neural systems: an entrainment phenomenon, promoted by real-time dyadic behavior. © 2023 The Author(s);koul2023spontaneousdya;False;Study Design | Collaborative scenario with >= 1 remote interaction manipulative ([virtually] separated during interaction);['EEG', 'Eye-tracking', 'camera-based tracking'];within-subjects;46;healthy adults;dyad;['ff', 'mm'];familiar;['FTF', 'FTF v-b'];non-verbal IM;open-ended;analog;eye-contact/gaze-based tasks;high;['connectivity functional', 'machine learning supervised'];social cognition;['learning', 'Granger causality', 'no collaboration']

However, the temporal dynamics of inter-brain synchronization during collaboration are not yet fully understood. Furthermore, with collaboration increasingly happening online, the dependence of inter-brain phase synchronization of oscillatory activity on physical presence is an important but understudied question. In this study, physically isolated participants performed a collaborative coordination task in the form of a cooperative multiplayer game. We measured EEG from 42 subjects working together as pairs in the task. During the measurement, the only interaction between the participants happened through on-screen movement of a racing car, controlled by button presses of both participants working with distinct roles, either controlling the speed or the direction of the car. Pairs working together in the task were found to have elevated neural coupling in the alpha, beta, and gamma frequency bands, compared to performance matched false pairs. Higher gamma synchrony was associated with better momentary performance within dyads and higher alpha synchrony was associated with better mean performance across dyads. These results are in line with previous findings of increased inter-brain synchrony during interaction, and show that phase synchronization of oscillatory activity occurs during online real-time joint coordination without any physical co-presence or video and audio connection. Synchrony decreased during a playing session, but was found to be higher during the second session compared to the first. The novel paradigm, developed for the measurement of real-time collaborative performance, demonstrates that changes in inter-brain EEG phase synchrony can be observed continuously during interaction.;wikstrom2022interbrainsync;True;;EEG;within-subjects;42;healthy adults;dyad;['ff', 'fm', 'mm'];familiar;virtual;shared digital IM w/out verbal IM;goal-driven;digital;cooperation/competition tasks;low;['spatial domain sensor', 'connectivity effective', 'connectivity functional', 'temporal domain frequency'];['motor', 'attention', 'executive function', 'visuospatial cognition'];['EEG electrode number: 64']

Thus, the process of belief updating plays an important role in conditional cooperation. Using the Prisoner's Dilemma Game (PDG) with event-related potential (ERP) hyperscanning, this study investigated the dynamics of belief updating in a dyad. During the task, participants were asked if they believed that their opponent would cooperate in the next trial, and their answers functioned as a self-reported index of reciprocal belief. The results suggested that this index shows strong associations with participants' behavioral choices (cooperate/betray). At the individual level, the amplitudes of the ERP components frontal P3a and parietal P3b elicited by the decision outcome were sensitive to belief updating. At the interpersonal level, the between-subject synchronization in P3b was higher than those in the other conditions when the paired participants confirmed each other's reciprocal beliefs. Since previous studies have linked the P3b with memory updating, we suggest that a cooperative relationship is built up when the memory systems (which support belief updating) of two interacting persons reach a high level of coordination. These findings may help explain how conditional cooperation develops between strangers. © 2019";zhang2019thedynamicsofb;True;;EEG;within-subjects;74;healthy adults;dyad;['ff', 'mm'];unfamiliar;FTF v-b;separate digital IM w/out verbal IM;goal-driven;digital;cooperation/competition tasks;high;temporal domain time;['social cognition', 'executive function'];['EEG electrode number: 32']

Yet, how mortality threat (MT) impacts our daily social behavior remains elusive. To address this issue, we developed a dyadic experimental model and recruited 86 adults (43 dyads) to complete two computer-based tasks (i.e. competitive and cooperative button-pressing). We manipulated dyads' awareness of death [MT vs neutral control (NC)] and simultaneously measured their neurophysiological activity using electroencephalography during the task. Several fundamental observations were made. First, the MT group showed significantly attenuated competition and slightly promoted cooperation. Second, compared to NC, MT significantly decreased gamma-band inter-brain synchronization (IBS) in the competitive context, which was associated with increased subjective fear of death within dyads. Notably, those effects were context-specific: we did not observe comparable results in the cooperative context. Finally, a machine-learning approach was successfully used to discriminate between the MT and NC groups based on accumulated IBS. Together, these findings indicate that MT to some extent mitigates interpersonal competition, and such mitigation might be associated with changes in gamma-band IBS.;zhou2021mortalitythrea;True;;EEG;between-subjects;60;healthy adults;dyad;['ff', 'mm'];n/s;SBS v-b;separate digital IM w/out verbal IM;goal-driven;digital;cooperation/competition tasks;high;connectivity functional;motor;['EEG electrode number: 64']

We studied how pairs of human subjects (referred to as dyads) collaborate physically to attenuate external mechanical perturbations during a target tracking task. Subjects tracked a target moving in a slow and predictable way using wrist flexion/extension movements, with and without destabilizing torque perturbations. Dyad strategies were classified using interaction torques and muscular activity. During unperturbed interactions (baseline), the dyads tended to stabilize on a particular strategy. The baseline strategy was not the same in all dyads, suggesting that the solution to the task was not global but specific to each particular dyad. After several trials of unperturbed interactions, we introduced mechanical vibrations and analyzed the adaptation process. Dyads showed a tendency to counteract the external disturbances by first increasing co-contraction within each subject (independent co-contraction), and then raising the amount of opposing interaction torques (dyadic co-contraction) with increased perturbation amplitude. The introduction of perturbations impelled dyads to abandon their unperturbed baseline strategy and adopt a more common strategy across dyads, suggesting attractor solutions. Our results establish a framework for future human-human interaction studies, and have implications in human motor control as well as human-robot and robot-robot interactions. © 2015.";melendezcalderon2015interpersonals;True;;EMG;within-subjects;10;healthy adults;dyad;['ff', 'mm'];unfamiliar;SBS v-b;separate digital IM w/out verbal IM;goal-driven;digital;coordination tasks;high;['other', 'temporal domain time'];motor;['muscle co-contraction analysis']

However, due to the complexity of studying ecologically valid synchronous team actions, requiring multiple members and a range of subjective and objective measures, the mechanism underlying the impact of synchrony on team performance is still unclear. In this paper, we simultaneously measured groups of nine-participants' (total N = 180) fronto-temporal activations during a drum beating task using functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)-based hyperscanning and multi-brain network modeling, which can assess patterns of shared neural synchrony and attention/information sharing across entire teams. Participants (1) beat randomly without considering others' drumming (random condition), (2) actively coordinated their beats with the entire group without other external cue (team-focus condition), and (3) beat together based on a metronome (shared-focus condition). Behavioral data revealed higher subjective and objective measures of drum-beat synchronization in the team-focus condition, as well as higher felt interdependence. The fNIRS data revealed that participants in the team-focus condition also showed higher interpersonal neural synchronization (INS) and higher Global Network Efficiency in their left TPJ and mPFC. Higher left TPJ Global Network Efficiency also predicted higher actual synchrony in the team-focus condition, with an effect size roughly 1.5 times that of subjective measures, but not in the metronome-enabled shared-focus condition. This result suggests that shared mental representations with high efficiency of information exchange across the entire team may be a key component of synchrony, adding to the understanding of the actual relation to team work.;liu2021teamworkteambr;False;Study Design | Collaborative scenario with >= 1 remote interaction manipulative ([virtually] separated during interaction);['fNIRS'];['within-subjects'];180;['healthy adults'];more (n group = 9;['fm'];['unfamiliar'];['FTF'];['physical IM w/out verbal IM'];['goal-driven'];['analog'];['coordination tasks'];['high'];['connectivity functional', 'spatial domain source'];['attention'];[]

The visualizations, such as borders highlighting current reviewed code lines, transition lines connecting related reviewed code lines, reveal the visual attention about program functions that can facilitate understanding and bug tracing. This can help novice reviewers to make sense to confirm the potential bugs or avoid repeated reviewing of code, and potentially even help to improve reviewing skills.

During such activities, team members need to communicate with each other to coordinate the modeling activities, propose and justify changes, and negotiate common terms and definitions. Throughout this process, stakeholders should be aware of when and what kind of changes have been made by each team member on the shared space so that they can discuss design ideas and build on each other’s work. Joint visual attention has a fundamental role in establishing and maintaining common ground among interlocutors in such cooperative work settings. In addition to this, the co-constructed model’s quality is often considered a key evaluation outcome measure to assess the success of collaboration. However, process and outcome measures of collaboration have been prone to difficulties due to challenges in devising measures that can adequately capture the complex dynamics of collaborative work. This study explored the relationship between a popularly used outcome measure in the business process modeling literature and a process measure approximating the level of joint visual attention present among the participants based on the degree of gaze cross-recurrence among the team members over a shared task space. The results suggest that joint visual attention as operationalized in terms of gaze cross-recurrence was a strong predictor of the syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic qualities of collaboratively produced business process models. Moreover, the collaboration process was subjected to qualitative analysis to probe further into the interactional organization of the modeling activity, which identified communication, coordination, awareness, group decision making, and motivation dimensions as key factors contributing to the quality of collaboration among group members. The results indicated strong relationships between the distribution of quality factors and the degree of gaze cross-recurrence and the final models’ syntactic and semantic quality scores.Given the increasing availability of affordable eye trackers and the lowresolution, practical nature of the employed analysis methodology, the proposed approach can be fruitfully employed to evaluate team performance and test the effectiveness of software interfaces designed to support collaborative work.;fndkcoskuncay2022aninvestigatio;True;;Eye-tracking;within-subjects;27;healthy adults;triad;n/s;n/s;virtual;separate digital IM w/out verbal IM;goal-driven;digital;ecologically valid setting;high;temporal domain time;['attention', 'social cognition', 'executive function'];['screen', 'TOBII X2-60 eye-tracker']

This study aimed to unveil the interpersonal neural correlates that underlie the effect of group educational diversity on group creativity. One hundred and sixteen college students were assigned to high educational diversity (HD; the members respectively majored in science or social science) or low educational diversity (LD; the members both majored in either science or social science) groups based on their academic majors. They were required to solve two problems that either demanded creativity (alternative uses task, AUT) or not (object characteristics task). We used functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)-based hyperscanning to simultaneously record the neural responses of pairs of interacting participants in each group. The LD group showed more AUT fluency and perspective-taking behaviours than the HD group, whereas no group difference was observed for AUT uniqueness. Additionally, collective flexibility was higher in the HD group than in the LD group. The fNIRS results showed that the interpersonal brain synchronisation (IBS) increments at the right angular gyrus and right primary somatosensory cortex were greater in the LD group than in the HD group. These findings indicate that although high educational diversity benefits cognitive flexibility, it does not necessarily lead to a better idea quality or greater idea quantity. The greater IBS increments and perspective-taking behaviours that we observed in the LD group may account for this.

Here we investigate how eye-contact affects the frequency and direction of the synchronization within and between two brains and the corresponding network characteristics. We also evaluate the functional relevance of eye-contact networks by comparing inter- and intra-brain networks of friends vs. strangers and the direction of synchronization between leaders and followers. We show that eye-contact increases higher inter- and intra-brain synchronization in the gamma frequency band. Network analysis reveals that some brain areas serve as hubs linking within- and between-brain networks. During eye-contact, friends show higher inter-brain synchronization than strangers. Dyads with clear leader/follower roles demonstrate higher synchronization from leader to follower in the alpha frequency band. Importantly, eye-contact affects synchronization between brains more than within brains, demonstrating that eye-contact is an inherently social signal.

Furthermore, BCIs can increase human's performance not only due to human-machine interactions, but also thanks to an optimal distribution of cognitive load among all members of a group working on a common task, i.e., due to human-human interaction. The latter is of particular importance when sustained attention and alertness are required. In every day practice, this is a common occurrence, for example, among office workers, pilots of a military or a civil aircraft, power plant operators, etc. Their routinely work includes continuous monitoring of instrument readings and implies a heavy cognitive load due to processing large amounts of visual information. In this paper, we propose a brain-to-brain interface (BBI) which estimates brain states of every participant and distributes a cognitive load among all members of the group accomplishing together a common task. The BBI allows sharing the whole workload between all participants depending on their current cognitive performance estimated from their electrical brain activity. We show that the team efficiency can be increased due to redistribution of the work between participants so that the most difficult workload falls on the operator who exhibits maximum performance. Finally, we demonstrate that the human-to-human interaction is more efficient in the presence of a certain delay determined by brain rhythms. The obtained results are promising for the development of a new generation of communication systems based on neurophysiological brain activity of interacting people. Such BBIs will distribute a common task between all group members according to their individual physical conditions. © 2018 Frontiers Media S.A.

By studying groups of university students (N = 36) who participated in their online classes under the COVID-19 social distancing mandates, we strive to understand the interrelation between individual affective states and their collaborative group members. Theoretically underpinned by the socially shared regulation of learning framework, our research features a cutting-edge insight into how learners socially shared regulation in group-based tasks. Findings accentuate fundamental added values of AI application in education, whilst indicating further interesting patterns about student self-regulation in the collaborative learning environment. Implications drawn from the study hold strong potential to provide theoretical and practical contributions to the exploration of AI supportive roles in designing and personalizing learning needs, as well as fathom the motion and multiplicity of collaborative learning modes in higher education.;ngo2024facialexpressi;False;Intervention | fNIRS, EEG, EDA, ECG, PPG, eye-tracking, camera-based tracking (of physiological measures or eyes);camera-based tracking;within-subjects;36;healthy adults;['dyad', 'triad'];n/s;n/s;virtual;verbal IM;open-ended;digital;ecologically valid setting;high;machine learning supervised;['language', 'social cognition'];['remote', 'learning', 'cooperation task', 'visual / camera-based tracking of facial expressions']

Specific patterns of caregiver–child conversations have been linked to children’s socio-cognitive development and child-relationship quality beyond the immediate family environment. Recently, interpersonal neural synchronization has been proposed as a neural mechanism supporting conversation. Here, we present a functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) hyperscanning study looking at the temporal dynamics of neural synchrony during mother–child conversation. Preschoolers (20 boys and 20 girls, M age 5;07 years) and their mothers (M age 36.37 years) were tested simultaneously with fNIRS hyperscanning while engaging in a free verbal conversation lasting for 4 min. Neural synchrony (using wavelet transform coherence analysis) was assessed over time. Furthermore, each conversational turn was coded for conversation patterns comprising turn-taking, relevance, contingency and intrusiveness. Results from linear mixed-effects modeling revealed that turn-taking, but not relevance, contingency or intrusiveness predicted neural synchronization during the conversation over time. Results are discussed to point out possible variables affecting parent–child conversation quality and the potential functional role of interpersonal neural synchronization for parent–child conversation.";nguyen2020neuralsynchron;False;Population | >= 2 clinically healthy adult participants that are interacting and scanned simultaneously;fNIRS;within-subjects;80;['children', 'healthy adults'];dyad;['ff', 'fm'];parent-child;FTF;shared physical IM and verbal IM;open-ended;analog;ecologically valid setting;high;['connectivity functional', 'spatial domain source'];social cognition;['wavelet transform coherence', 'fNIRS channel number: 16']

Using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) hyperscanning, we tested the effects of preceding physical synchrony on subsequent dyadic teaching-learning communication. Thirty-two pairs of participants performed two experimental sessions. In each session, they underwent a rhythmic arm movement block with synchronous or asynchronous conditions, and then taught/learned unknown words to/from each other according to a given scenario. Neural activities in their medial and left lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) were measured and inter-brain synchronization (IBS) during the teaching-learning blocks was evaluated. Participants rated their subjective rapport during the teaching-learning blocks, and took a word memory test. The analyses revealed that (1) prior physical synchrony enhanced teacher-learner rapport; (2) prior physical synchrony also enhanced IBS in the lateral PFC; and (3) IBS changes correlated positively with rapport changes. Physical synchrony did however not affect word memory performance. These results suggest that IBS can be useful to measure the effects of social-bonding facilitation activities for educational communication.

Despite its positive effect on productivity and quality of work, it poses challenges to co-authors in remote settings because of limitations in conversational grounding and activity awareness. This paper presents Eye-Write, a novel system which allows two co-authors to see at will the location of their partner's gaze within a text editor. To investigate the effect of shared gaze on collaboration, we conducted a study on synchronous remote collaborative writing in academic settings with 20 dyads. Gaze sharing improved five aspects of perceived collaboration quality: mutual understanding, level of joint attention, flow of communication, level of negotiation, and awareness of the co-author's activity. Furthermore, dyads whose participants deactivated the gaze visualization showed a smaller degree of collaboration. Our findings offer insights for future text editors by outlining the benefits of at-will gaze sharing in collaborative writing.;kutt2019eyewritegazesh;True;;Eye-tracking;within-subjects;40;healthy adults;dyad;n/s;['familiar', 'unfamiliar'];BTB;separate digital IM and verbal IM;mixed;digital;ecologically valid setting;high;other;['attention', 'language'];['screen', ' analysis amount of gaze-sharing', 'Tobii 4C eye tracker']

The study considered joint attention behaviour as a sociolinguistic phenomenon and relied on detailed qualitative interaction analysis on event-related measures of multiple observational data (i.e. log files, eye-tracking data). The aim was to illustrate and exemplify how the diverse attentional levels of joint attention behaviour (i.e. monitoring, common, mutual and shared attention) delineated by Siposova and Carpenter (Cognition 89:260–274, 2019) were achieved in remote collaborative problem solving in dyads, including the underlying basis of joint attention behaviour (i.e. individual attention experience). The results made visible the complex functioning of the social aspects of remote collaborative problem solving and provided preliminary insights into how the hierarchical and nested levels of ‘jointness’ and common knowledge were achieved in this context.

Earlier research has confirmed, through structured experimental paradigms, that these interactions could be underpinned by coordinated neural activity. Nevertheless, the extent of neural synchrony during real-life, ecologically valid interactions between mothers and their children remains largely unexplored.
In this study, we investigated mother–child inter-brain synchrony using a naturalistic free-play paradigm. We also examined the relationship between neural synchrony, verbal communication patterns and personality traits to further understand the underpinnings of brain synchrony.
Twelve children aged between 3 and 5 years old and their mothers participated in this study. Neural synchrony in mother–child dyads were measured bilaterally over frontal and temporal areas using functional Near Infra-red Spectroscopy (fNIRS) whilst the dyads were asked to play with child-friendly toys together (interactive condition) and separately (independent condition). Communication patterns were captured via video recordings and conversational turns were coded.
Compared to the independent condition, mother–child dyads showed increased neural synchrony in the interactive condition across the prefrontal cortex and temporo-parietal junction. There was no significant relationship found between neural synchrony and turn-taking and between neural synchrony and the personality traits of each member of the dyad.
Overall, we demonstrate the feasibility of measuring inter-brain synchrony between mothers and children in a naturalistic environment. These findings can inform future study designs to assess inter-brain synchrony between parents and pre-lingual children and/or children with communication needs.

The difference between using head-gaze and eye-gaze to estimate the point of regard was studied, the motive being that recording head-gaze is easier and cheaper than eye-gaze. Two experiments are reported, the first investigates the effect of a high immersion presentation of the game in VR Head Mounted Display compared with a lower immersion desktop presentation. The second examines the high immersion condition in more detail. The studies show that in spite of there being many factors that could affect the outcome of a relatively short period of game play, sharing eye-gaze in the high immersion condition produces shorter overall durations and better subjective ratings of team work than does sharing head-gaze. This difference is not apparent in the low immersion condition. The findings are a good argument for exploiting the opportunities for including and using eye tracking within head mounted displays in the context of collaborative games. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

To characterize the direction within and between brain connectivity in winning and losing players in a competitive brain-computer interface game.Approach. Ten dyads (26.9 ± 4.7 yr old, eight females and 12 males) participated in the study. In a competitive game based on neurofeedback, they used their relative alpha (RA) band power from the electrode location Pz, to control a virtual seesaw. The players in each pair were separated into winners (W) and losers (L) based on their scores. Intrabrain connectivity was analyzed using multivariate Granger causality (GC) and directed transfer function, while interbrain connectivity was analyzed using bivariate GC.Main results. Linear regression analysis revealed a significant relationship (p\textbackslashtextless 0.05) between RA and individual scores. During the game, W players maintained a higher RA than L players, although it was not higher than their baseline RA. The analysis of intrabrain GC indicated that both groups engaged in general social interactions, but only the W group succeeded in controlling their brain activity at Pz. Group L applied an inappropriate metal strategy, characterized by strong activity in the left frontal cortex, indicative of collaborative gaming. Interbrain GC showed a larger flow of information from the L to the W group, suggesting a higher capability of the W group to monitor the activity of their opponent.Significance. Both innate neurological indices and gaming mental strategies contribute to game outcomes.

Recent research has shown that people's brain activity becomes synchronized with others' (inter-brain synchrony) during social engagement. However, little is known as to whether inter-brain synchrony relates to collective behavior within teams. Here, we merge the nascent field of group neuroscience with the extant literature of team dynamics and collective performance. We recruited 174 participants in groups of 4 and randomly assigned them to complete a series of problem-solving tasks either independently or as a team, while simultaneously recording each person's brain activity using an electroencephalography hyperscanning setup. This design allowed us to examine the relationship between group identification and inter-brain synchrony in explaining collective performance. As expected, teammates identified more strongly with one another, cooperated more on an economic game, and outperformed the average individual on most problem-solving tasks. Crucially, inter-brain synchrony, but not self-reported group identification, predicted collective performance among teams. These results suggest that inter-brain synchrony can be informative in understanding collective performance among teams where self-report measures may fail to capture behavior. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

Although they offer convenience and effectiveness in various contexts, there is a pertinent question about whether they truly replicate the richness of in-person communication. This study delves into the distinctions between online and face-to-face interactions, with a particular focus on the synchronization of brain activity. Previous research has indicated a connection between synchronization and the quality of communication. Therefore, our hypothesis posits that face-to- face interactions lead to greater brain synchronization compared to online interactions, which often lack certain social cues. To investigate this, we conducted a study using functional near-infrared spectroscopy hyperscanning during an eye-contact task involving 28 male participants organized into 14 pairs. We assessed brain signal synchronization using wavelet coherence analysis. After comparing face-to-face and online conditions, our findings revealed significantly higher synchronization in face- to-face scenarios, particularly within the right temporoparietal region. These results align with the outcomes of other hyperscanning studies and suggest that face-to-face communication elicits a higher level of brain synchronization compared with online communication. In the future, this approach holds promise for evaluating the effectiveness of online meeting tools in achieving a more authentic virtual communication experience.;sato2025synchronizatio;False;Study Design | Collaborative scenario with >= 1 remote interaction manipulative ([virtually] separated during interaction);fNIRS;within-subjects;28;healthy adults;dyad;mm;familiar;['FTF', 'virtual'];['non-verbal IM', 'separate digital IM w/out verbal IM'];goal-driven;mixed;eye-contact/gaze-based tasks;high;connectivity functional;social cognition;['fNIRS channel number: 44', 'wavelet transform coherence']

Three experimental conditions were tested: in-person collaboration, remote collaboration, and single user. We hypothesized that collaboration focuses users’ attention on key information facilitating decision-making. Collaborating participants dwelt longer on key elements of the simulation than single users. Moreover, in-person collaboration and single users yielded a strategy of decision-making similar to an optimal strategy. Finally, in-person collaboration was less cognitively demanding and of higher quality. The contribution of this article is a deeper understanding of how in-person collaboration on a large display can help users focus their visual attention on the most important areas. With this novel understanding, we believe collaborative systems designers will be better equipped to design more effective attention-guiding mechanisms in remote collaboration systems.

Here, we explore potential effects of virtual interactions on observed behavior, subjective experience, and neural “single-brain” and “interbrain” activity via functional near-infrared spectroscopy neuroimaging. We scanned a total of 36 human dyads (72 participants, 36 males, 36 females) who engaged in three naturalistic tasks (i.e., problem-solving, creative-innovation, socio-emotional task) in either an in-person or virtual (Zoom) condition. We also coded cooperative behavior from audio recordings. We observed reduced conversational turn-taking behavior during the virtual condition. Given that conversational turn-taking was associated with other metrics of positive social interaction (e.g., subjective cooperation and task performance), this measure may be an indicator of prosocial interaction. In addition, we observed altered patterns of averaged and dynamic interbrain coherence in virtual interactions. Interbrain coherence patterns that were characteristic of the virtual condition were associated with reduced conversational turn-taking. These insights can inform the design and engineering of the next generation of videoconferencing technology.

However, how the interpersonal coordination pattern modulates coordination outcome and the related brain-to-brain connectivity is not fully understood. Here, we adopted a continuous joint drawing task in which two participants co-drew parallelogram shapes according to two coordination patterns (i.e., IP vs. MP) while their brain activities were simultaneously recorded by the functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) based hyperscanning technique. Dyads showed better coordination performance, as well as relatively greater interpersonal brain synchronization (IBS) at the left frontopolar area, in the MP condition compared to the IP condition. Granger causality analyses further disclosed the bidirectional influences between the brains of the coordinating individuals. Such interpersonal influences were enhanced when individuals coordinated in the MP condition. Finally, the IBS during coordination was related to the dyadic self-control level. Taken together, our study revealed that interpersonal multifrequency coordination pattern facilitates the coordination efficiency, which was associated with the enhanced brain-to-brain connectivity. Our work also suggests the potentially positive role of self-control during the interpersonal coordination process. © Copyright © 2019 Cheng, Pan, Hu and Hu.";cheng2019coordinationel;True;;fNIRS;within-subjects;62;healthy adults;dyad;['ff', 'fm'];unfamiliar;FTF v-b;separate digital IM w/out verbal IM;goal-driven;digital;coordination tasks;high;['connectivity effective', 'connectivity functional'];['motor', 'visuospatial cognition'];['fNIRS channel number: 13', 'screen', 'Granger causality', 'wavelet transform coherence']

Depending on the context, cooperation and competition can amplify or neutralize a team's problem solving ability. Therefore, to assess successful collaborative problem solving, it is first crucial to distinguish competitive from cooperative interactions. We investigate the feasibility of using lightweight brain sensors to distinguish cooperative from competitive interactions in pairs of participants (N=84) playing a decision-making game involving uncertain outcomes. We measured brain activity using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) from social, motor, and executive areas during game play alone and in competition or cooperation with another participant. To distinguish competitive, cooperative, and alone conditions, we then trained support vector classifiers using combinations of features extracted from fNIRS data. We find that features from social areas of the brain outperform other features for discriminating competitive, cooperative, and alone conditions in cross-validation. Comparing the competitive and alone conditions, social features yield a 5% improvement over motor and executive features. Social features show promise as means of distinguishing competitive and cooperative environments in problem solving settings. Using fNIRS data provides a real-time measure of subjective experience in an ecologically valid environment. These results have the potential to inform intelligent team monitoring to provide better real-time feedback and improve team outcomes in naturalistic settings.

Some participants searched the visual display more efficiently and made faster decisions when working as a team, whereas other dyads did not benefit from working together. These inter-team differences in behavioral performance gain in the visual search task were reliably associated with inter-team differences in local and inter-brain phase synchronization.

Various metrics are used to characterize synchrony between participants such as crosscorrelation, weighted coherence, or cross recurrence quantification analysis and with a wide variety of paradigms. We propose the delayed coincidence count as a new method for assessing cardiac synchrony. Delayed coincidence count has already been used to characterize synchrony in firing neurons populations. While being straightforward and computationally light, this method has already been formally proven to be statistically robust. A complex dynamic microworld is designed with two difficulty levels and two cooperation conditions. A total of 40 participants, i.e., 20 teams, voluntarily has conducted the experiment.

In this study, participant dyads performed either a coordination task or an independence task, with their brain activations recorded via the functional near-infrared spectroscopy hyperscanning technique. Participant dyads in the coordination group showed higher synchronized behaviors and greater subsequent inclination to help each other than those in the independence group, indicating the prosocial effect of interpersonal synchrony. Importantly, the coordination group demonstrated the significant task-related brain coherence, namely the interbrain synchronization, at the left middle frontal area. The detected interbrain synchronization was sensitive to shared intentionality between participants and was correlated with the mutual prosocial inclination. Further, the task-related brain coherence played a mediation role in the prosocial effect of interpersonal synchrony. This study reveals the relevance of brain-to-brain synchronization among individuals with subsequent mutual prosocial inclination and suggests the neural mechanism associating with shared cognition for the facilitation of interpersonal synchrony on prosociality. © The Author (2017).

It is widely understood that both communication mode and students’ knowledge state contribute to the teaching effectiveness (i.e., higher students’ scores), but the nature of the interplay of these factors and the underlying neural mechanism remain unknown. In the current study, we manipulated the communication modes (face-to-face [FTF] communication mode/computer-mediated communication [CMC] mode) and prior knowledge states (with vs. without) when teacher–student dyads participated in a teaching task. Using functional near-infrared spectroscopy, the brain activities of both the teacher and student in the dyads were recorded simultaneously. After teaching, perceived teacher–student interaction and teaching effectiveness were assessed. The behavioral results demonstrated that, during teaching with prior knowledge, FTF communication improved students’ academic performance, as compared with CMC. Conversely, no such effect was found for teaching without prior knowledge. Accordingly, higher task-related interpersonal neural synchronization (INS) in the left prefrontal cortex (PFC) was found in the FTF teaching condition with prior knowledge. Such INS mediated the relationship between perceived interaction and students’ test scores. Furthermore, the cumulative INS in the left PFC could predict the teaching effectiveness early in the teaching process (around 25–35 s into the teaching task) only in FTF teaching with prior knowledge. These findings provide insight into how the interplay between the communication mode and students’ knowledge state affects teaching effectiveness. Moreover, our findings suggest that INS could be a possible neuromarker for dynamic evaluation of teacher–student interaction and teaching effectiveness. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.;liu2019interplaybetwe;True;;fNIRS;between-subjects;42;healthy adults;dyad;['ff', 'mm'];instructor-student;['FTF', 'virtual'];['non-verbal IM', 'separate digital IM w/out verbal IM'];open-ended;digital;ecologically valid setting;low;connectivity functional;social cognition;['fNIRS channel number: n/s (estimate 39)', 'wavelet transform coherence', 'screen']

Three communication mode conditions were created: natural (N), turn-taking (T), and electronic brainstorming (E). Participants were randomly recruited and grouped in dyads to solve one alternative uses task (AUT) in each condition, during which functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)-based hyperscanning was used to record interpersonal neural responses. No difference was observed in AUT fluency across the three conditions, but AUT uniqueness was higher in the T condition than in the E condition. In addition, AUT uniqueness, AUT fluency, and perspective-taking behaviours increased faster in the T condition than in the other conditions. The T condition also showed higher perspective-taking behaviours than did the other conditions. Moreover, fNIRS data showed higher interpersonal brain synchronisation (IBS) increments at the right angular gyrus in the T condition than in the other conditions, which positively predicted perspective-taking behaviours between individuals during group creativity tasks. These findings indicate that when group members create together while taking turns, both creative performance and interpersonal interaction processes can be stimulated. © 2020 The Author(s);lu2020creatingwhilet;True;;fNIRS;within-subjects;54;healthy adults;dyad;['ff', 'mm'];unfamiliar;['FTF', 'virtual'];['verbal IM', 'separate digital IM w/out verbal IM'];open-ended;mixed;ecologically valid setting;high;connectivity functional;['language', 'social cognition'];['fNIRS channel number: 22', 'wavelet transform coherence', 'screen', 'alternative uses task']

However, little is known about interpersonal brain synchronization with respect to trust; in particular, the differences between individuals with and without siblings are not clear. Therefore, this study applied functional near-infrared spectroscopy hyperscanning in a sequential reciprocal-trust task. We divided pairs of participants (strangers) into two groups according to their only-child status. The two strangers interacted with one another in an online trust game while their brain activities in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the right temporoparietal junction (rTPJ) were measured. The behavioral results revealed that compared with the non-only-child group, the only-child group exhibited lower repayment, less reciprocation, and less cooperative decisions during the process. In addition, the brain imaging results showed that the interpersonal synchronization of the mPFC in the only-child group was significantly weaker than that in the non-only-child group. Our findings demonstrate neurobehavioral support for the only-child effect in terms of the trust by revealing that an only child shows less trust than does a non-only-child, resulting in lower inter-brain coherence. \copyright 2021 Elsevier Inc.";wu2021theonlychildef;False;Study Design | Collaborative scenario with >= 1 remote interaction manipulative ([virtually] separated during interaction);fNIRS;within-subjects;48;healthy adults;dyad;['ff', 'mm'];unfamiliar;FTF v-b;separate digital IM w/out verbal IM;goal-driven;digital;economic exchange tasks;high;connectivity functional;social cognition;['no collaboration task']

Most studies on conceptual design of designer teams focused primarily on behavioral aspects, leaving cross-brain coupling neural mechanisms underlying designer teams' collaboration unexplored. Investigating inter-brain synchrony (IBS) offers a critical perspective on how shared neural activity supports key collaborative processes, such as coordination, communication, and team creativity. This study investigated the effects of design interaction modes (face-to-face vs. remote virtual vs. electronic brainstorming; FTF vs. RV vs. EBS) on designer teams' interactive behaviors and IBS during conceptual design. Using fNIRS-based hyperscanning, neural activities in the right prefrontal cortex and right temporoparietal junction (r-TPJ) were recorded for 72 designers (36 dyads), and behavioral characteristics, IBS, and temporal dynamics of these metrics across modes were analyzed. Results showed that FTF teams outperformed RV and EBS in creative design performance, cooperation level, team flexibility, perspective-taking, and turn- taking. Creative design performance and cooperation level increased over time across all modes, particularly in FTF and RV, while team flexibility, perspective-taking, and turn-taking initially rose before declining, notably in FTF and RV. fNIRS data revealed greater IBS in r-TPJ and between r-TPJ and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (r-DLPFC) in RV compared to FTF and EBS, both following a U-shaped temporal trend. Cooperation level, perspective-taking, and turn-taking positively correlated with RIBS in r-TPJ, while cooperation level correlated with RIBS between r-TPJ and r-DLPFC. These results highlight distinct behavioral and neural synchronization patterns across interaction modes in designer teams during conceptual design process, with FTF mode performing best. These findings enhanced understanding of designer teams' interactive cognition, contributed to design neurocognition research, and offered practical implications for designing tools and training programs to optimize team performance.";wu2025influenceofdes;True;;fNIRS;within-subjects;72;healthy adults;dyad;['ff', 'fm', 'mm'];unfamiliar;['FTF', 'SBS v-b', 'virtual'];['shared physical IM and verbal IM', 'separate digital IM w/out verbal IM', 'separate digital IM w/out verbal IM'];open-ended;mixed;ecologically valid setting;high;['temporal domain time', 'spatial domain source', 'connectivity functional', 'temporal domain frequency'];other;['fNIRS channel number: 23', 'wavelet transform coherence', 'screen', 'design task']

In this study, we identified within-group neural synchronization in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (rDLPFC) and the right temporoparietal junction (rTPJ) as a candidate mechanism underlying intergroup hostility. We organized 546 individuals into 91 three-versus-three-person intergroup competitions, induced in-group bonding or no-bonding control manipulation and measured neural activity and within-group synchronization using functional near-infrared spectroscopy. After in-group bonding (versus control), individuals gave more money to in-group members than to out-group members and contributed more money to outcompete their rivals. In-group bonding decreased rDLPFC activity and increased functional connectivity between the rDLPFC and the rTPJ. Especially during the out-group attack, in-group bonding also increased within-group synchronization in both the rDLPFC and the rTPJ, and within-group rDLPFC synchronization positively correlated with intergroup hostility. Within-group synchronized reduction in prefrontal activity might explain how in-group bonding leads to impulsive and collective hostility toward outsiders.;yang2020withingroupsyn;False;Population | >= 2 clinically healthy adult participants that are interacting and scanned simultaneously;fNIRS;mixed;516;healthy adults;more (n_group = 6);['fm', 'mm'];['familiar', 'unfamiliar'];FTF;separate digital IM and verbal IM;mixed;mixed;cooperation/competition tasks;high;['connectivity functional', 'spatial domain source'];['social cognition', 'executive function'];['fNIRS channel number: 52', 'wavelet transform coherence']

Conversation partners often pause between conversational turns, and musical co-performers often pause between musical phrases. How do humans coordinate the duration of pauses to ensure seamless interaction? A total of 40 trained pianists performed a simple melody containing fermatas (notated expressive pauses of unspecified duration) first alone (Solo) and then with a partner (Duet) while electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded. As predicted, Duet partners' tone onset synchrony was reduced for tones following pauses. Pauses were shorter in Duet relative to Solo performance, and synchrony of partners' Duet tone onsets was enhanced for tones following shorter pauses. EEG analysis revealed classic signatures of action preparation during pauses, namely decreases in the power of cortical beta oscillations (13-30 Hz, event-related desynchronization ERD). Beta ERD did not differ between pauses in Solo and Duet performance, but was enhanced for shorter relative to longer pauses, suggesting that reduced pause durations in Duet performance facilitated a neural state of enhanced action readiness. Together these findings provide novel insight into behavioural strategies by which musical partners resolve coordination challenges posed by expressive silence, and capture a clear neural signature of action planning during time-varying silences in natural music performance.;zamm2021thesoundofsile;False;submission after publication;EEG;within-subjects;40;healthy adults;dyad;n/s;n/s;SBS v-b;physical IM w/out verbal IM;goal-driven;analog;coordination tasks;high;['temporal domain frequency', 'spatial domain sensor'];['other'];['EEG electrode number: 32', 'music']

Video communication is growing rapidly in popularity for initiating and maintaining personal relationships, but it is unknown if video communication is as effective as face-to-face communication for promoting friendliness. This study compared the development of subjective friendliness between video and face-to-face communication sessions and investigated the associated neural correlates. Thirty healthy same-sex pairs were recruited and randomly assigned to face-to-face (Face) and video communication (Video) groups. Both groups performed three communication conditions face-to-face or via the Zoom platform in separate rooms: singing a song alone, singing a song with the other pair, and listening to the other pair sing a song. Activities of the bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) were measured during the condition by functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), and subjective friendliness was assessed before and after each condition using the Profile of Mood States 2nd Edition (POMS-F). After each condition, the change in POMS-F score (∆POMS-F) was compared between groups, and correlations were calculated with regional brain activity measures. Face group showed an increase in all conditions in ∆POMS-F, and Video group showed in average a decrease, which results in significant group difference in ∆POMS-F. The Face group showed a significant positive correlation between right DLPFC activity and increase in ∆POMS-F, whereas the Video group showed marginal significant negative correlation. Additionally, left DLPFC activity was significantly higher and MPFC activity was significantly lower in the Video group than in the Face group during all conditions. These findings suggest that subjective feelings of friendliness may be limited during video communication due to a requirement for greater cognitive effort. © 2025 The Author(s);yamaya2025videocommunica;True;;fNIRS;mixed;60;healthy adults;dyad;['ff', 'mm'];familiar;['FTF', 'virtual'];verbal IM;goal-driven;mixed;coordination tasks;high;spatial domain source;language;['fNIRS channel number: 16', 'screen']

In this study, we asked pairs of participants (labeled as A and B) to individually toss a coin and report their outcomes; their collective benefit could be maximized by dishonestly reporting (a corrupt behavior). As expected, the likelihood of corrupt behavior was high; this probability was negatively correlated with player A's moral judgment ability but positively correlated with player B's empathic concern (EC). Functional near-infrared spectroscopy data revealed that the brain-to-brain synchronization in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was associated with fewer corrupt behaviors, and that it mediated the relationship between player A's moral judgment ability and corrupt collaboration. Meanwhile, the right temporal-parietal junction synchronization was associated with more corrupt behaviors, and that it mediated the relationship between player B's EC and corrupt collaboration. The roles of these 2 regions are interpreted according to the influence of the honesty and reciprocity norms on corrupt collaboration. In our opinion, these findings provide insight into the underlying mechanisms and modulating factors of corrupt collaboration. © 2023 The Author(s). Published by Oxford University Press.

Leaders were more sacrificial and their contribution influenced group survival to a greater extent during in-group defence than during out-group attacks. Leaders also had increased DLPFC activity when defending in-group, which predicted their comparatively strong contribution to conflict; followers reciprocated their leader’s initiatives the more their DLPFC activity synchronized with that of their leader. When launching attacks, however, leaders and followers aligned poorly at behavioural and neural levels, which explained why out-group attacks often failed.

Here we hypothesized that interpersonal neural synchronization (INS) might underlie collaborative remembering, while real collaboration as opposed to other modes of offline collaboration should enhance INS and facilitate mnemonic similarity. To test these hypotheses, brain activity was measured simultaneously from two individuals who performed a group-based selective retrieval practice task either in a real collaboration or in a pseudo-collaboration, i.e., an individual performed the task together with a pre-recorded audio. The results showed that the memory of two individuals converged to a greater level than the chance level in real collaboration but not in control condition. Moreover, collaborative remembering was associated with significant INS increase in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) relative to the baseline in the real collaboration only. Additionally, INS increase was significantly greater in the real collaboration than in control condition. Finally, the PFC's INS increase was positively correlated with and could accurately predict the level of mnemonic similarity in real collaboration. These findings support the hypothesis that the enhanced INS underlies the cognitive process of collaborative remembering. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd;zhang2023interpersonaln;True;;fNIRS;between-subjects;84;healthy adults;dyad;['ff', 'mm'];unfamiliar;['SBS', 'SBS v-b'];shared digital IM and verbal IM;goal-driven;mixed;cooperation/competition tasks;low;spatial domain sensor;['memory', 'language'];['fNIRS channel number: 31', 'screen', 'wavelet transform coherence']

Our results showed that left and right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) for storytelling teaching versus traditional teaching, superior temporal gyrus for storyboard teaching versus traditional teaching, and left angular gyrus for storyboard and storytelling teaching were significant different in brain synchronisation. In the storytelling teaching condition, left supramarginal gyrus brain synchrony was found to improve STEM learning outcomes. In the storyboard teaching condition, IFG brain synchrony correlated positively with STEM learning improvement.

In this study, groups of elderly couples and matched cross-sex controls were recruited to perform a competitive button-pressing task, while their brain signals were simultaneously collected using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) hyperscanning. Several fundamental observations were made. First, controls showed attenuated interpersonal competition across task processes, but couples held the competition with each other. Second, couples demonstrated increased inter-brain synchronization (IBS) between the middle temporal cortex and the temporoparietal junction across task processes. Third, Granger causality analysis in couples revealed significant differences between the directions (i.e., from men to women, and from women to men) in the first half of the competitive task, whereas there was no significant difference in the second half. Finally, the groups of couples and controls could be successfully discriminated against based on IBS by using a machine-learning approach. In sum, these findings indicate that elderly couples can maintain interpersonal competition, and such maintenance might be associated with changes in the IBS of the mentalizing system. It suggests the possible positive impact of long-term spouse relationships on interpersonal interactions, both behaviorally and neurally, in terms of competition. © 2023 by the authors.;zhang2023interpersonalc;False;Study Design | Collaborative scenario with >= 1 remote interaction manipulative ([virtually] separated during interaction);fNIRS;within-subjects;70;healthy adults;dyad;fm;['familiar', 'unfamiliar'];SBS;['shared digital IM and verbal IM', 'shared digital IM w/out verbal IM'];goal-driven;digital;cooperation/competition tasks;high;['connectivity functional', 'machine learning supervised'];social cognition;['fNIRS', 'learning', 'hyperscanning', 'competition task', 'Granger causality', 'wavelet transform coherence']

Group members' collaborative knowledge construction plays an important role in successful collaborative learning. Evidence has proven the implicit character of learners' collaboration and the fact that tasks of diverse complexity can promote the development of learners' cognitive abilities in different aspects. So we investigated how learners' collaborative knowledge construction processes varied across tasks of diverse complexity levels, combining explicit behavior with implicit physiological indicators. This study used content analysis, hyperscanning technology based on electroencephalograms (EEG), and epistemic network analysis (ENA) to analyze the data of 28 triads who participated in two 30-minute online collaborative tasks. According to the frequency results, learners' asking questions and planning (TaskPlan) behaviors in collaborative design tasks are significantly higher than those in collaborative concept explanation tasks. The ENA results further demonstrate that, in comparison to collaborative concept explanation tasks, the connectivity coefficients between asking questions and mutual understanding, planning (SociPlan) and mutual understanding, alongside monitoring (SociMoni) and mutual understanding are all higher in collaborative design tasks. Additionally, EEG data show that learners had higher inter-brain synchronization in the collaborative design task compared to the collaborative concept explanation task. The comprehensive analysis of multiple data points to the fact that in collaborative concept explanation tasks, learners place greater emphasis on the comprehension and construction of concepts, while in collaborative design tasks, learners attach more importance to social interactions among team members which calls for more asking questions and planning behaviors. The research findings can help teachers understand the collaborative learning processes of diverse complexity tasks.

Whether the interpersonal relationship and the characteristics of the individuals in the group affected the group decision-making under uncertainty in the real-time interaction remains unknown. Using the turn-based Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART), the present study examined the group decision-making propensity under uncertainty with partners in different interpersonal relationships and interpersonal orientations. Corresponding inter-brain synchronization (IBS) patterns at the prefrontal cortex (PFC) were also uncovered with the fNIRS-based hyperscanning approach. Behavioral results identified that dyads in the friend group exhibited the uncertainty-averse propensity when comparing with the stranger group. The fNIRS results reported that feedback-related IBS at the left inferior frontal gyrus (l-IFG) and medial frontopolar cortex (mFPC) during different feedbacks was modulated by interpersonal relationships. The IBS at all channels in the PFC during the positive and negative feedbacks, respectively, predicted the decision-making propensity under uncertainty in the stranger and friend groups based on the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm. The moderating role of the social value orientation (SVO) was also verified in the mediation effect of the dyad closeness on the decision-making propensity under uncertainty via the IBS at the right lateral frontopolar cortex (r-FPC). These findings demonstrated disparate behavioral responses and inter-brain synchronization patterns underlying group decision-making under uncertainty with partners in different interpersonal relationships. © 2023 The Author(s);zhao2023distinctinterb;False;Study Design | Collaborative scenario with >= 1 remote interaction manipulative ([virtually] separated during interaction);fNIRS;within-subjects;120;healthy adults;dyad;['ff', 'mm'];['familiar', 'unfamiliar'];SBS;shared digital IM w/out verbal IM;goal-driven;digital;economic exchange tasks;low;['spatial domain source', 'connectivity effective', 'temporal domain frequency'];['social cognition', 'executive function'];['dyad', 'fNIRS', 'hyperscanning', 'Granger causality', 'wavelet transform coherence']

Using wavelet transform coherence analysis, we calculated the inter-brain coherence between the two participants based on their fNIRS signals from the prefrontal, left motor, and right temporoparietal brain regions. Correlation analysis between the neural coherence and the cooperation performance revealed that the increased synchrony in the right prefrontal and temporoparietal region was positively associated with the overall cooperation performance on the task.

A novel cooperative task was designed in which dyadic participants assumed the role of an operator or a navigator with different skills and knowledge and worked together to complete the task.

The functional connections between the rTPJ and the other brain areas indicated the involvement of the mirror neural system during the task. Further directional analysis using Granger causality analysis revealed a flow of information from the temporal to the parietal and then to the pre-motor cortex in the operator's brain.

84;84;10.1016/j.cognition.2022.105307;Konvalinka, Ivana and Sebanz, Natalie and Knoblich, Günther;2023;The role of reciprocity in dynamic interpersonal coordination of physiological rhythms;A central question in social cognition research is how people coordinate their bodily rhythms, and how important reciprocity of interaction is for interpersonal coordination. Previous research has primarily focused on interpersonal action coordination, which has been shown to be facilitated by mechanisms of prediction and mutual adaption. Recent research is beginning to show that people also coordinate their physiological rhythms (i.e., respiration, heart rhythms) when they engage in natural forms of social interaction, such as conversation, choir singing, and rituals. However, the mechanisms underlying interpersonal physiological synchronization remain obscure, and could provide insight into the dynamic mechanisms that underlie continuous and regulatory, rather than instrumental, joint actions. Using real-time biofeedback, we investigated whether people synchronize their respiration rhythms by forming a joint dynamical system through reciprocity of interaction, or by producing more predictable respiration rhythms. Our results show that people are more in-phase synchronized but less phase-locked when interacting bidirectionally versus unidirectionally (online), but there is no difference in synchronization during reciprocal interaction and when adapting unidirectionally (offline) to recordings of respiration signals that emerged during the reciprocal interaction. Moreover, the strength of synchronization is driven by the predictability of the respiration rhythms that emerge in the bidirectional interaction – specifically, the slowing of breathing rhythms and stability of breathing frequencies – rather than the online mutual adaptation itself. These results suggest that coordination is facilitated by the emergence of predictable breathing patterns, rather than reciprocity itself. © 2022 The Authors;konvalinka2023theroleofrecip;True;;other;within-subjects;24;healthy adults;dyad;['ff', 'fm'];unfamiliar;virtual;separate digital IM w/out verbal IM;goal-driven;digital;['coordination tasks', 'imitation tasks'];['high', 'low'];['temporal domain time', 'temporal domain frequency'];motor;['respiration', 'phase locking value']

Cai, Dan";2024;Exploring the role of mutual prediction in inter-brain synchronization during competitive interactions: an fNIRS hyperscanning investigation;Mutual prediction is crucial for understanding the mediation of bodily actions in social interactions. Despite this importance, limited studies have investigated neurobehavioral patterns under the mutual prediction hypothesis in natural competitive scenarios. To address this gap, our study employed functional near-infrared spectroscopy hyperscanning to examine the dynamics of real-time rock-paper-scissors games using a computerized paradigm with 54 participants. Firstly, our results revealed activations in the right inferior frontal gyrus, bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and bilateral frontopolar cortex, each displaying distinct temporal profiles indicative of diverse cognitive processes during the task. Subsequently, a task-related increase in inter-brain synchrony was explicitly identified in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, which supported the mutual prediction hypothesis across the two brains. Moreover, our investigation uncovered a close association between the coherence value in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the dynamic predictive performances of dyads using inter-subject representational similarity analysis. Finally, heightened inter-brain synchrony values were observed in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex before a draw compared to a no-draw scenario in the second block, suggesting that cross-brain signal patterns could be reflected in behavioral responses during competition. In summary, these findings provided initial support for expanding the understanding of cognitive processes underpinning natural competitive engagements.Mutual prediction is crucial for understanding the mediation of bodily actions in social interactions.
